   <h1>Technology and society</h1>
    <p>Our society is more reliant on technology than ever. Technology has contributed
    to our society in many ways including easier access to communication and entertainment
    and bringing new opportunities to more people. We can just call or text each other instead
    of having to send letters. Easier access to the internet is important for free speech,
    as sharing opinions and criticisms is much easier online. We can share a lot, like international
    food recipes, funny videos, our political views, and much more. Innovations in 
    software and hardware make our devices more accessible to everyone, including people with 
    disabilities and people with a worse socio-economic status. Screen readers  are an example of this,
    and some more niche examples are anti-tremor spoons for people with Parkinson’s disease or 
    AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) software that people with speech impediments 
    or other disabilities can use to communicate.</p>

    <p>We depend so much on technology that many of us wouldn’t survive a single day without our phones.
    However, everything comes with its downsides. As mentioned earlier, everyone who has access to the
    internet has an equal right of speech. This has made issues like discrimination, revenge porn and
    cyber bullying a trivial task for malicious users. Doing these things to other people is much easier
    when done behind a screen. Research from 2017 shows that thoughts about suicide increased by 
    14.5% because of cyberbullying among adolescents in the US. </p>

    <p>There are also potential issues with technology that isn’t in use yet. An example of this is artificial
    intelligence and machine learning which is slowly being adopted by car manufacturers. The infamous moral
    dilemma of “Who should the self-driving car kill?” is often brought up in this context. In a hypothetical
    scenario where a fully autonomous car meets a person crossing a road, and it doesn’t have enough time to brake,
    should the car swerve to avoid hitting the pedestrian or keep driving straight ahead? If it tries turning away,
    it could crash into a tree on the side of the road or a car coming from the opposite lane, and potentially
    killing its passengers. The software must be programmed or trained with some bias for such situations.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, our society is heavily reliant on the technology around us, but it has many downsides
    and potential issues. Going back to the stone age or stifling innovation is not a realistic option,
    so how do we remedy these issues? </p>
