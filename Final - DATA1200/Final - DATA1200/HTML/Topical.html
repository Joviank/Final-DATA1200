   <h1>Technology and society</h1>
    <p>Our society is more reliant on technology than ever. Technology has contributed
    to our society in many ways including easier access to communication and entertainment
    and bringing new opportunities to more people. We can just call or text each other instead
    of having to send letters. Easier access to the internet is important for free speech,
    as sharing opinions and criticisms is much easier online. We can share a lot, like international
    food recipes, funny videos, our political views, and much more. Innovations in 
    software and hardware make our devices more accessible to everyone, including people with 
    disabilities and people with a worse socio-economic status. Screen readers  are an example of this,
    and some more niche examples are anti-tremor spoons for people with Parkinson’s disease or 
    AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) software that people with speech impediments 
    or other disabilities can use to communicate.</p>

    <p>We depend so much on technology that many of us wouldn’t survive a single day without our phones.
    However, everything comes with its downsides. As mentioned earlier, everyone who has access to the
    internet has an equal right of speech. This has made issues like discrimination, revenge porn and
    cyber bullying a trivial task for malicious users. Doing these things to other people is much easier
    when done behind a screen. Research from 2017 shows that thoughts about suicide increased by 
    14.5% because of cyberbullying among adolescents in the US. </p>

    <p>There are also potential issues with technology that isn’t in use yet. An example of this is artificial
    intelligence and machine learning which is slowly being adopted by car manufacturers. The infamous moral
    dilemma of “Who should the self-driving car kill?” is often brought up in this context. In a hypothetical
    scenario where a fully autonomous car meets a person crossing a road, and it doesn’t have enough time to brake,
    should the car swerve to avoid hitting the pedestrian or keep driving straight ahead? If it tries turning away,
    it could crash into a tree on the side of the road or a car coming from the opposite lane, and potentially
    killing its passengers. The software must be programmed or trained with some bias for such situations.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, our society is heavily reliant on the technology around us, but it has many downsides
    and potential issues. Going back to the stone age or stifling innovation is not a realistic option,
    so how do we remedy these issues? </p>

    <h2>Top 10 Ways Universal Design Can Help to Live a Longer and Happier Life</h2>

    <p>Universal design is a tool that sheds light on creating technology for a helpful and user-friendly
    experience for everyone. This comes in handy for people with various disabilities and for those who are older.
    Here are some examples of universal designs that can help create a better and easier everyday life for the elderly.</p>

    <p>Many older people have problems with muscles and joints that make it difficult to move as they once did.
    That is why it is very important to have products such as sliding doors, lifts, stairlifts, and electric
    wheelchairs. These are all examples of products of universal design that can be used by everyone, but that may
    be necessary for some. For the elderly, it is important to be able to get both in and out of a building by using
    sliding doors, especially if you are in a wheelchair, it is also important that the wheelchair can be used even if
    you do not have mobility in your arms. Elevators are great for getting to your desired floor, even if you 
    are in a wheelchair, have poor eyesight, or have poor hearing. You will also find lifts in the home, 
    such as stairlifts. It acts as a chair that leads the person safely up to the floor of their own home.</p>

    <p>Many older people, for example, struggle with their hearing, and then, for example, a hearing aid comes in handy.
    They also struggle with everyday tasks, for example, and then google home and, for example, robot vacuum cleaners can
    be good to have. These devices help to automate tasks in the home so that the elderly can avoid doing them. A PC or
    mobile phone can be helpful in that you can stay up to date through online newspapers or be able to keep in good
    contact with family through phone, SMS, and email. Electric beds also help by making it easier to get in and out of bed.
    It can also make sleep better at better position.</p>
