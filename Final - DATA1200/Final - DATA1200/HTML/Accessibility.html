        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>Some of the preliminary changes we made before testing our websites include:
            We added alt tags to important images (excluding some like the background images since those are just decorative).
            We made sure all text, including menu items and the content itself, had a high contrast for readability. 
            This means that all of the text on our pages has a dark background and a light font. This also somewhat
            improves the side-effects of the background image animation.
        </p>
        <p>We use an animated background that cycles between images. It was initially somewhat distracting and
            made it difficult to focus on the content on the page. We chose to slow it down a lot, which is a 
            little less visually appealing but less distracting. The page hides the navigation icons and shows
            a hamburger menu icon instead on narrow displays. This eliminates the need to hit tiny touch targets
            (such as on a small phone screen) and is more visually pleasing. 
        </p>

        <p>After testing with several automated testing websites, we made the following changes:
            1. Fixed some minor errors in our code, such as the position of the script-tag
            (which apparently should not be inside the body-tag). 2. We initially did not add 
            alt-text to the navigation icons, but they also need to be readable by screen readers. 
        </p>

        <p>The navigation icons are animated and the selected page is highlighted in white.
        This is done to make navigation easier and so the user can easily identify the buttons.</p>

        <p>We chose to not animate the OsloMet logo. We were unsure whether or not it was necessary to animate
        the logo. However, we decided to keep the logo as it is, since both the oslomet.no and Canvas
         websites use the logo as a button AND it isn’t animated at all.</p>

        <p>Some of the manual tests we did include 
                testing with VoiceOver on an iPhone, 
                navigating the website using only the keyboard
                using a wide range of text sizes and screen sizes to test the functionality of the website. 
                This gave us useful insight on how different people will navigate the website and the issues they could face.
                Some of the changes we made include making more descriptive alt-text. 
        </p>

         <p>We chose to upload the website as a zipped file because some pictures are not free to use.
            Some of the pictures in the fun page are copyrighted, as the assignment allowed for this.</p>  
            
        <p>We used the W3C CSS Validation Service <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">(jigsaw.w3.org)</a> 
        to check our css code. It showed that all of our css was correct and that there were no errors.
        The “fun page” was also approved and includes
        a valid css code. </p>
